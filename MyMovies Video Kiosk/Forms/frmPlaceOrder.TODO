Add a button to frmSearch that adds movie to list without opening the frmPlaceOrder
add a messagebox to confirm that movie was added to list
add button to frmPlaceOrder to return to search 
change cancel button to clear out order

...

OR 
have frmSearch add movies to order table instead of adding to a list... ? Yeah, this is the ticket.
