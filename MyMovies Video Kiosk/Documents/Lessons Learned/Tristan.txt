Lessons Learned:
	I learned a ton of useful things over the course of this project. Most importantly would be starting and how to use GitHub, it was not a requirement
	but using it helped me so that I could use it at a real job in the future. I also learned plenty of things within VB. Before this i had never used multiple
	forms across one program. I also leanred about using Data sources and holding information submitted by users. As with any group project there is always
	going to be issues with working in groups etc. This project went smoothly mostly due to my amazing teammates. I learned a lot and if i had to do anything different
	it would probably be just to be a solo project so i could learn every angle. Otherwise it was a amazing experience.
